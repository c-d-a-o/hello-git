            <h2>Let’s get straight to the point</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>What is CDAO?</strong></li>
                <p>CDAO stands for College DAO. It’s basically a DAO aimed towards college students.</p>
                <li><strong>No, but… what is CDAO?</strong></li>
                <p>CDAO is a web3 based community that encourages not only coding among its members but also any type of skill you might possess.</p>
                <li><strong>Wait..wait… what exactly IS CDAO?</strong></li>
                <p>CDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that uses a democratic model of governance for its decision making and is a community of tech enthusiasts that work towards growing the community or want help for their own personal projects.</p>
                <li><strong>Hol’ up…WHAT IN THE ACTUAL F***K IS CDAO?</strong></li>
                <p>Huff !!! Ok, if that’s where you want to go. Maybe I have just the right stuff for you 🤫. As you seem to be unconvinced and apparently a bit bitter about the definitions I gave above let’s talk about the working bodies of CDAO.</p>
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Content Funnel:</strong></li>
                <p>This funnel is all about bridging the information gap. When we encounter a lack of high-quality technical resources on the internet, we take it upon ourselves to fill that void. Our talented members work together to create and share valuable content, from tutorials and guides to in-depth articles and videos. This not only enhances our own knowledge base but also contributes to the wider educational ecosystem.</p>
                <li><strong>Project Funnel:</strong></li>
                <p>In the project funnel, we venture into the exciting world of technology and innovation. Here, we encourage collaboration among our members to tackle ambitious projects. Whether it's building a groundbreaking app, designing cutting-edge software, or inventing a novel solution to a real-world problem, we believe in the power of teamwork. Together, we aim to create something substantial and impactful that can make a difference.</p>
                <li><strong>Collaboration Funnel:</strong></li>
                <p>Collaboration is at the heart of CDAO, and the collaboration funnel is where this spirit truly shines. We leverage the strength of our diverse and talented community to forge partnerships and secure advantageous deals. By pooling our collective resources, knowledge, and skills, we're not only able to take on more significant endeavors but also to thrive as a community. The rewards earned from these collaborations are distributed among contributors, incentivizing growth among the members.</p>
                <li><strong>Oh so that’s what CDAO is….</strong></li>
